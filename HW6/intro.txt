Instructions

Please implement the booklist assignment using classes.  

You can modify and reuse much of the code you wrote for Homework 4, but make sure to implement the functions as members of the class Booklist. 

The main function should create a new instance of the Booklist class.  For example:

Booklist book_list;

Notice: your class must have both public methods and private instances

and then call the functions to do the necessary operation. For example, for printing the list:

book_list.print();

Please use 3 files for this assignment. The class declaration goes in the header file. The class definition should be in a .cpp file, and the class implementation could be in the Main file. Adhere to the naming instructions.

 

"Booklist_lastName.h".

"Booklist_lastName.cpp" 

"Main_lastName.cpp"
